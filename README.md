# Bangalore Home Price Prediction

This project demonstrates how to predict the price of a home in Bangalore using Machine Learning (ML). We will guide you through the entire process of building a predictive model with Python, covering key steps in data science, from data loading to model evaluation. The project uses a dataset sourced from Kaggle, and we apply various techniques like data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Project Overview

In this project, the goal is to predict the sale price of homes in Bangalore based on various features like location, size, number of bedrooms, and more. We apply key data science techniques to clean the data, build the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary language used for this project.
- **Numpy & Pandas**: Used for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for visualizing the data and results.
- **Sklearn**: Used for building and evaluating machine learning models, including Linear Regression.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for developing and presenting the project.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project contains information about various homes in Bangalore, including features such as:

- Size (in square feet)
- Location
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- and more...

The target variable is the **price** of the home.

You can find the dataset on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, duplicates, and errors.
3. **Outlier Detection and Removal**: Identify and remove any outliers in the dataset.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Transform raw data into meaningful features.
5. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduce the number of features if needed to improve model performance.
6. **Model Building**: Build a linear regression model using Scikit-learn.
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use GridSearchCV to tune the model’s hyperparameters.
8. **Cross-validation**: Use K-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model’s performance.

## Model Building Process

The process of model building follows these key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is in the right format for modeling.
2. **Feature Selection & Engineering**: Identify relevant features and transform the data for better model performance.
3. **Linear Regression Model**: Train the model using a linear regression algorithm.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV**: Use GridSearchCV to find the best combination of hyperparameters.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model performance using cross-validation and various metrics.

## Results & Evaluation

After applying the above steps, the model’s performance is evaluated using various metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-Squared, etc. The final model's performance is compared to baseline models to understand its effectiveness in predicting home prices.
